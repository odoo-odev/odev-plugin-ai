# ODEV - AI Plugin

This plugin acts as a core library to integrate Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities across the `odev` framework. It
provides a unified, simple interface for interacting with various AI providers, allowing other plugins to easily
leverage AI for tasks like code generation, translation, and analysis.

This plugin is a foundational component and is used by other plugins such as `scaffold` and `translate`.

## Configuration

Configuration is handled automatically when you first install `odev` or enable the AI plugin. You will be prompted to
select your preferred LLM provider and enter the corresponding API key.
